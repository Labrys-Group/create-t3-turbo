# Tools

A list of tools we encourage you to use when you need such functionality.

## Existing tools

1. See [package.json](./../package.json) for tools you might already have at your disposal
2. See [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/Labrys-Group/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/package.json) if there's a lib that does the job
3. See [our Shadcn common registry](https://github.com/Labrys-Group/common-registry) if there's a lib that does the job
4. See [core library stack](https://www.notion.so/labrys/ee2e6813c3d94cc8ad476c8ecabd09a6?v=7e3f0bfb970941638f9ce6ddffbd36db&source=copy_link)

## Other and new packages

Should none of the above work, or you have a better idea, please verbalise it in `#dev-team`, so we can decide together if that's the right tool, if it's safe to use, or if we have a better alternative. If accepted, add them [in this file](https://github.com/Labrys-Group/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/docs/tools.md).
